# SKSpriteBuddy

SKSpriteBuddy is the framework to work with game assests generated by Sprite Buddy app within `SpriteKit` based games.
Always that you export your assets on `Sprite Buddy`, the iPad app exports a `<EntityName>.xml` file that have all the information about the game element's structure, skins and animations. And your assets organized in folders that represents the entity's bones. Use `SKSpriteBuddy` framework to instantiate entity's objects, load and set skins and load and run animations.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

SKSpriteBuddy is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod 'SKSpriteBuddy'
```

## How to use

- Drag and drop the `<EntityName>.xml` file into your SpriteKit project on `Xcode`.
- Drag and drop the asset folders into the `Assets.xcassets` folder.
- Use the SKInkAnimator API to instantiate entity objects, set skins and run animations

#### Instantiating an entity object:
```swift
import SKSpriteBuddy
...
let entity = try await IAEntity(withName: "EntityName")
self.scene.addChild(entity)
```

#### Setting entity's skins:
```swift
try await entity.setSkin(named: "Dark_Knight")
```
#### Running animations:
```swift
// run the animation once
try await entity.run(animationNamed: "Running")

// Run the animation 3 times
try await entity.run(animationNamed: "Idle" , times: 3)

// Run the animation forever
try await entity.runForever(animationNamed: "Running")
```

#### Preloading Skins:

```swift
// Preloading the textures for skin named "Knight"
try await entity.preload(skinNamed: "Knight")

// Preloading textures for a set of skins
try await entity.preload(skins: ["Dark_Knight", "Light_Knight", "Golden_Knight"])

// Releasing unused textures from memory
entity.releaseSkin(named: "Dark_Knight")
```

#### Preloading Animations:

```swift
// Preloading the animation named "Running"
try await entity.preload(animationNamed: "Running")

// Preloading a set of animations
try await entity.preload(animations: ["Running", "Idle"])

// Releasing unused animations from memory
entity.releaseAnimation(named: "Running")
```

```ruby
pod "SKSpriteBuddy"
```
